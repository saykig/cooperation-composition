# Initial repository audit

The supplied Bellman working directory contained only
`.git` when inspected on 2026-08-13. `git status` reported main with no commits;
`git remote -v` returned no remotes. There were no tracked or untracked historical
artifacts, mathematical documents, code, or repository AGENTS.md to inspect.
The user supplied the instruction to create no branches and commit/push regularly.
No existing Bellman mathematical organization can be assessed from this checkout.
This is missing evidence, not evidence that no other Bellman repository exists.

Available computation: Python 3; Lean toolchains 4.27.0, 4.30.0, 4.33.1, but no
configured global default. Use a project-local pinned toolchain, leaving global
configuration untouched. Git author configuration is present.

Publication note: the initial local audit contained an absolute workstation path;
that path is omitted here under the fetched repository instructions. Its substantive
observations are unchanged. The original local commit is retained in a local Git
recovery bundle, not published as part of Bellman history.
